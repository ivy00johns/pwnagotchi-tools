# Pwnagotchi-Tooling

In this repo I am working on refactoring different repos that are no longer maintained.
* [Pwnagotchi-Tools](https://github.com/mtagius/pwnagotchi-tools): [mtagius](https://github.com/mtagius)
* [Pwnagetty](https://github.com/CyrisXD/Pwnagetty/): [CyrisXD](https://github.com/CyrisXD)

My goal is to create an updated version of the Windows setup and setup a new NodeJS based OS X version.
